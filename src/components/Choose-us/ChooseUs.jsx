              With the consistent improvements in technologies associated with learning, it is no longer just about rolling out courses and expecting the learners to consume it. The learning process has to be refined to cater to the needs of the future workforce. Skill Lake is one of the few platforms that has been designed from the ground up to ensure learning not only happens effectively, but also places the learner at a vantage point.
